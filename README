Villa-Lobos Contour Module (VLCM)

by Marcos di Silva and Pedro Kröger

This is a module of Villa-Lobos, the software for computer musicology
developed by Genos [1]. VLCM began as Goiaba, a software developed to
process musical contours, during Marcos di Silva master's degree
[2]. This software has implementations of Contour Theories functions
[3].
