Villa-Lobos Contour Module (VLCM)

by Marcos di Silva and Pedro Kröger

This is a module of Villa-Lobos, the software for computer musicology
developed by Genos [1]. VLCM began as Goiaba, a software developed to
process musical contours, during Marcos di Silva master's degree
[2]. In addition to melodic contour, VLCM can process contour related
to other parameters such as duration, dynamics and chord density.
This software provides Contour Theories functions [3].
