MusiContour
===========

MusiContour is a musical contour relations calculator, that plots and
calculates mathematical operations on musical contours. MusiContour
has a few `Contour Theories <contour-theories.html>`_ functions
implemented, like prime form, comparison matrix and internal
diagonals.

MusiContour is designed for Linux, but also runs in Windows. It's
developed in Python. Next versions will be part of `Visimus
<http://visimus.com>`_ Music Visualization toolkit.
