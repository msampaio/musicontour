About
=====

MusiContour is developed by `Marcos da Silva Sampaio
<http://marcosdisilva.net>`_ and `Pedro Kröger
<http://pedrokroger.net/>`_ from `Genos Research Group`_. The research
on musical contour relations has the support of `Francis Strappa
<http://genos.mus.br/wiki/Pessoas#Francis_Strappa>`_.

MusiContour is the third name of the software that began as `Goiaba
<github.com/mdsmus/goiaba>`_, than became the `Villa-Lobos
<github.com/kroger/villa-lobos>`_ contour module, and now is again
independent, as MusiContour.
